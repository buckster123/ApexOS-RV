## Why a driver at all (the gap)

We have the *pieces* of a state machine (TurnGate, evolution, self-update, council, the bus reducer)
but not the *object*: a first-class, observable, **bounded**, resumable run. Autonomy today is
yolo + scheduled tasks + prompting — capable, but the *run itself* can't be held, watched, budgeted,
or stopped cleanly. The `Goal` is that object; the board (Phase 1) is its window.

The driver is the **scheduler generalized**: `scheduler.rs` already advances work by emitting the
next `UserPrompt` on the bus at a cron time. A goal does the same — emit the next step until a guard
says stop. Same bus, same `TurnGate`, same turn engine.

---

## The `Goal` object

```rust
// new: apexos_core (wire type) + a goals.json store (like mesh_sessions.json)
struct Goal {
    id:         GoalId,        // newtype u64
    objective:  String,        // the human's goal, verbatim
    session:    SessionId,     // a DEDICATED session (not root 0) → its turns gate independently
    state:      GoalState,
    step:       u32,
    max_steps:  u32,           // HARD ceiling (the overnight-run governor)
    token_budget: u64,         // optional hard token cap (0 = none)
    consecutive_failures: u32, // failure breaker
    posture:    GoalPosture,   // policy stance for unattended steps (see below)
    history:    Vec<(GoalState, /* ts */ u64)>,
    last:       String,        // last directive sent (for resume / audit)
}

enum GoalState { Planning, Acting, Blocked, Reflecting, Done, Failed }

// Revives the currently-dead `SubagentsConfig.inherit_mode` field as a real knob:
enum GoalPosture {
    Yolo,       // unattended: auto-approve within the goal (overnight runs)
    AskBlocks,  // an `ask` tool → a BLOCKED card on the board, never a silent stall
}
```

A goal runs in its **own `SessionId`** (allocated from `next_session_id`, like a mesh session), so
its turns serialize through the `TurnGate` independently and never pollute root session 0 (the
sensor/scheduler funnel). The board gets a lane per goal.

---

## The driver loop (deterministic — a `scheduler.rs` sibling)

One `tokio` task owns the goal set. Per goal, the loop is:

```
start                → state = Acting; emit step directive on the bus (UserPrompt{goal.session})
on TurnComplete(g)   → read the goal_step signal the agent reported this turn:
    done             → state = Done.    stop.
    continue{next}   → step += 1;
                       if step >= max_steps OR budget exhausted → state = Failed (bounded). stop.
                       else emit `next` as the directive. (back to Acting)
    blocked{reason}  → state = Blocked. park (board card). await human resume.
    (none / errored) → consecutive_failures += 1;
                       if failures >= FAILURE_BREAKER (e.g. 3) → state = Failed. stop.
                       else re-emit with a corrective nudge.
emit Event::GoalStateChanged on every transition (board + event log).
```

**Hard guards, enforced in code (never the LLM):** `max_steps`, `token_budget`, the consecutive-
failure breaker. The LLM's `done` is *advisory* — the guards always win. This is what makes an
overnight run safe to leave alone.

Every step is **one gated turn** (`UserPrompt → TurnGate → run_turn`), so the driver never spawns a
turn outside the gate — it reuses the exact serialization invariant. A goal step may itself
`agent_spawn` sub-agents; those run as they do today.

---

## The LLM hooks (exactly two)

1. **The work-turn** — the existing `run_turn`. The model does the actual work each step (review the
   lander, iterate it, run tools, spawn sub-agents). No change.
2. **`goal_step` — a new virtual tool** the agent calls to report a step's outcome:
   ```
   goal_step { status: "continue" | "done" | "blocked", next?: string, reason?: string }
   ```
   Routed to the driver over a dedicated mpsc (mirrors `propose_evolution`'s `set_propose_tx` — a
   busy turn can't lag-drop it on the broadcast bus). The driver consumes it on `TurnComplete` and
   transitions. Companion tools: `goal_create{objective, max_steps?, posture?}` (start a goal),
   `goal_cancel{id}`, `list_goals`.

That's the entire LLM surface: do the work, and propose the next move. Everything else is code.

---

## Termination & safety (the governor)

- **`max_steps`** — hard ceiling on turns. Default conservative (e.g. 20); the operator raises it for
  a long build.
- **`token_budget`** — optional hard token cap (accumulate per-goal from the usage parser).
- **Failure breaker** — N consecutive failed/empty steps → `Failed`, stop. Prevents a stuck goal
  from burning the night on a wall. (Directly answers the sub-2 snag: a goal can't silently grind.)
- **Never silently stall** — the rule the snag exposed. A step that can't proceed becomes a
  `Blocked`/`Failed` card with a reason, never a turn hanging on an approval no one sees.

---

## Policy stance for unattended steps (reviving `inherit_mode`)

The first live multi-agent run surfaced two facts: sub-agents run under the **one node-global
`PolicyEngine`** (so on a yolo node they auto-approve, on a suggest node a sub-agent's `ask` tool
would stall on an approval no human is watching), and **`SubagentsConfig.inherit_mode` is dead code**
(defined, never read). Phase 2 gives it meaning via `GoalPosture`:

- **`Yolo`** — the goal's steps auto-approve `ask` tools (the overnight-autonomy choice). Bounded by
  the goal's own guards, not by a human.
- **`AskBlocks`** — an `ask` tool becomes a **Blocked card** on the board with the tool + args; the
  human approves from the board (Phase 3 interactive), then the goal resumes. The supervised choice.

Either way: **no silent stalls.** The posture is per-goal, declared at `goal_create`.

---

## Observability (the snag's real lesson)

A failed sub-agent is currently near-invisible: agentd logs supervisor lifecycle but **not**
sub-agent tool/turn errors (they return to the parent as an `ok:false` ToolResult), and the board's
Phase-1 sub card just *clears* on `TurnComplete` regardless of success or failure. Phase 2 closes
this:

- A step/sub-agent that ends `ok:false` → a **FAILED card** (red) carrying the error text, into the
  goal's lane / RECENT — not a silent disappearance.
- `Event::GoalStateChanged` drives a **goal lane** on the board: the goal card shows state + step
  count + budget remaining; its sub-steps nest under it.
- The append-only event log already records the transition history → "rewind a goal" (Phase 3) is
  replay, not new persistence.

> Near-term, this failure-visibility upgrade is also a standalone win for the *existing* board
> (show FAILED sub-agent cards) — buildable before the full driver if we want the opacity gap closed
> immediately.

---

## Persistence & resume

- A `goals.json` store (`<log_dir>/goals.json`, the `mesh_sessions.json` pattern): `GoalId → Goal`.
- On boot, reload goals; in-flight ones (`Acting`/`Blocked`) re-enter as `Blocked{reason:"daemon
  restarted"}` → the human (or a `goal_resume`) restarts them. No half-run is silently abandoned.
- Cerebro episodes wrap a goal for the long-term record (the evolution-applier pattern), so a
  finished goal is a recallable memory.

---

## What's reused vs. new

| Reused (already in tree) | New (small) |
|---|---|
| `TurnGate` + router + `run_turn` (each step) | the driver task (a `scheduler.rs` sibling) |
| `agent_spawn` (fan-out within a step) | the `Goal` object + `GoalState`/`GoalPosture` |
| the broadcast bus + event log (history) | `Event::GoalStateChanged` + `GoalCreated` |
| the scheduler's `emit(UserPrompt)` driver pattern | `goal_step` / `goal_create` / `goal_cancel` / `list_goals` virtual tools |
| the usage parser (token budget) | `goals.json` store |
| the Work Board (Phase 1) | goal lanes + FAILED cards on the board |

No rewrites. The driver is additive; the turn engine, gate, policy, and board are untouched in their
core.

---

## Open decisions (resolve before/while building)

1. **`done` trust model.** Confirmed: advisory — guards are the hard stop. Should a `done` also run a
   cheap **verify step** (an LLM "did we actually meet the objective?" turn) before closing? (Council-
   style self-check; optional, costs one turn.)
2. **Default `max_steps` / budget.** Conservative default + operator override at `goal_create`.
3. **Multi-goal concurrency.** Goals are independent sessions → the `TurnGate` already serializes
   within each; across goals they run concurrently (bounded by `max_concurrent`). Cap the number of
   live goals?
4. **Where `goal_create` comes from.** A tool the agent calls (APEX decomposes "build a lander" into
   a goal), and/or a board "＋ New goal" affordance (Phase 3).
5. **Policy default.** `Yolo` posture only on a yolo node? Or always require explicit opt-in to
   unattended auto-approve?

## Build slices

- **P2a — driver skeleton.** ✅ **SHIPPED** — `agentd/src/goal.rs` (the driver) + `goal_create` virtual
  tool + `Event::GoalStateChanged` (protocol) + a **GOALS lane** on the board. A goal runs in its own
  session, driven step-by-step through the existing `TurnGate`; bounded by `max_steps` (Done) and a
  per-step stall timeout (Failed). No `goal_step` yet — each step re-prompts "continue"; early
  done/blocked is P2b.
- **P2b — the `goal_step` hook.** ✅ **SHIPPED** — `goal_step{status: continue|done|blocked, next?,
  reason?}` virtual tool routed to the driver; the agent's verdict is recorded for the in-flight step
  and applied on `TurnComplete` (advisory `done` ends early; `blocked` parks; `continue` can steer
  the next step via `next`); the budget/stall guards stay the hard stop. Also fixed the P2a off-by-one
  APEX caught live — `step` is now the **in-flight** step (1-indexed), so the board card tracks the
  running step (1/N … N/N → DONE) instead of the completed-count.
- **P2c — observability + visibility.** ✅ **SHIPPED (core)** — `Event::GoalStateChanged` gained a
  `detail` field, so **Blocked cards carry the reason** and **FAILED cards carry the stall note** (the
  snag's observability gap, closed on the board), plus a **`list_goals`** tool for root-session
  visibility ("is goal N still running?" without the board open — APEX's field ask). **Deferred to its
  own slice:** the `GoalPosture{Yolo|AskBlocks}` *policy override* (auto-approve-within-goal) — its
  hard half needs per-session policy threading into the supervisor, and it's latent on a yolo node
  (which already auto-approves `ask`), so it's untestable on apex1 and not worth bundling here.
- **P2d — persistence + resume.** ✅ **SHIPPED (core)** — goals persist to `goals.json` (`log_dir`,
  the `mesh_sessions.json` pattern) on every mutation; on boot they reload, and any goal that was
  mid-flight (Acting) when the daemon stopped re-enters **Blocked: "interrupted by daemon restart"**
  (never silently lost — critically, the nightly self-update binary swap no longer evaporates a
  running goal). A new **`goal_resume{goal_id}`** tool re-activates a Blocked/Failed goal at its last
  step.

- **Loop-closers (shipped after P2d).** ✅ **Cerebro episode wrap** — the driver got a `ToolProxy`;
  each goal is wrapped in an episode (`episode_start` on create → `episode_end` on Done/Failed with
  outcome+valence), so a finished run becomes a recallable, `dream_run`-able memory — the goal→cognition
  loop closed. ✅ **Block-on-approval** (the testable half of `GoalPosture`) — a goal step that hits an
  `ask`-gated tool emits `ApprovalPending` in its own unwatched session; the driver now parks the goal
  **Blocked: "awaiting approval — &lt;tool&gt;"** (surfaced on the board, resumable via `goal_resume`)
  instead of stalling silently. *Still deferred:* the per-goal **Yolo override** (auto-approve inside a
  goal on a suggest node) — needs per-session policy threading into the supervisor.

Each slice is its own PR. P2a is the keystone; the rest layer on without rewrites.

- **Field-test refinements (APEX, 2026-06-21, yolo OFF).** The first end-to-end run with global
  yolo *off* validated the headline features (board live, approvals surface, episode wrap +
  block-on-approval confirmed) but surfaced one real gap: **goal steps reflexively call ask-gated
  inspection tools** (`screenshot_mirror`, …) *before* doing the work, and under approval-gating each
  such call parked the goal — so trivial goals never ran. Three fixes:
  - **#1 Execution discipline** — `directive_first`/`directive_continue` now carry a shared
    `EXECUTION_DISCIPLINE` line: *go straight to the objective with the minimum tools; don't reach for
    inspection tools unless the objective needs them.* The fix at the point of authoring (the per-step
    prompt), so it can't be forgotten. This is the root-cause fix.
  - **#2 `goal_cancel{goal_id}`** — operator-stop a running/blocked goal: aborts the in-flight turn
    (`UserCancel` on the goal session), marks it the new **`GoalState::Cancelled`** (terminal, *not*
    resumable — distinct from Failed), closes the episode neutral. The recovery hatch APEX asked for —
    kill a stuck goal without a daemon restart. Policy `allow` (de-escalating: only halts the agent's
    own goal).
  - **#4 Don't-hang backstop** — `block_on_approval` now also `UserCancel`s the suspended turn (it was
    waiting on an approval that can never resolve into work once the goal is Blocked), so the session
    isn't left pinned; `goal_resume` re-runs the step cleanly (and, with #1, won't re-hit the
    inspection tool). The existing 900s stall timeout is now tunable via **`GOAL_STEP_TIMEOUT_SECS`**
    (≥30s floor) — handy to lower for live testing.
  - **#3 goal-scoped Yolo** ✅ **SHIPPED** (validated live by APEX, 2026-06-21 — test C showed the
    block→resume→block loop from the inside: *"Ship it."*). `goal_create{yolo:true}` lets a goal
    auto-approve its **OWN** `ask`-gated tools (run_command, git_push, …) so it runs unattended even
    when global approval is on — the genuinely-needs-approval case. Implementation = the
    `SessionBindings`-mirror pattern: a shared `apexos_core::GoalYoloSessions` (`Arc<Mutex<HashSet<u64>>>`)
    that the goal driver **arms** on create (and reload/resume for a resumable goal) and **disarms** on a
    terminal outcome (Done/Failed/Cancelled); the supervisor's approval gate (`supervisor.rs`) checks it
    in the `Decision::Ask` arm and **dispatches instead of parking** when the session is armed — scoped
    *strictly* to that goal's session, never root or another (fails closed on a poisoned lock). The flag
    persists in `goals.json` (`#[serde(default)]` → legacy goals reload gated) and rides the
    `GoalStateChanged{yolo}` event so the board shows a **⚡ AUTO** chip. `goal_cancel` is the kill
    switch; no new policy rule needed (`goal_create` is already `allow`). **The goal arc is now
    complete:** bounded · observable · LLM-steered · reason-bearing · restart-surviving ·
    cognitively-remembered · approval-safe · *and* autonomous for the hard cases.
